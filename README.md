## Calculate Summary Statistics of Titanic Passengers

## Project Overview
This project is part of my data analytics internship at TechnoHacks EduTech. In this project, I analyze the Titanic Passengers dataset to calculate summary statistics  such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. These statistics help in understanding the dataset quickly and effectively.

Dataset:
The Titanic Passengers dataset contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket price, passenger class, and survival status.
