## Calculate Summary Statistics of Titanic Passengers

## Project Overview
This project is part of my data analytics internship at TechnoHacks EduTech. In this project, I analyze the Titanic Passengers dataset to calculate summary statistics  such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. These statistics help in understanding the dataset quickly and effectively.

1. Dataset:
   The Titanic Passengers dataset contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket price, passenger class, and survival status.

2. Purpose:
The main purpose of this project is to understand the distribution and patterns in the Titanic dataset using summary statistics and data visualization techniques.

3.Tools and Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

4.Steps Performed:
- Loaded the Titanic dataset into Jupyter Notebook
- Performed basic data cleaning and exploration
- Calculated summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation
- Found minimum and maximum values for important features
- Created a correlation heatmap to understand relationships between variables

5.Summary Statistics:
- Mean: Average values of numerical features
- Median: Middle values for age and ticket price
- Mode: Most frequently occurring values
- Standard Deviation: Measure of data spread
- Minimum Value: Based on survival feature
- Maximum Value: Maximum values for each feature
