## Calculate Summary Statistics of Titanic Passengers
This project is part of my data analytics internship at TechnoHacks EduTech. In this project, I analyze the Titanic Passengers dataset to calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. These statistics help in understanding the dataset quickly and effectively.


These statistics help in summarizing and understanding the data quickly.

## Purpose
The purpose of summary statistics in data analysis and statistics is multifaceted and essential for understanding and interpreting data effectively.

### Summary Statistics

    Mean: [Mean value for each titanic passengers]
    Median: [Median value for age and ticket price of titanic passengers]
    Standard Deviation**: [Standard deviation for titanic passengers]
    Minimum Value: [feature based on survived]
    Maximum Value: [Maximum value for each feature]
